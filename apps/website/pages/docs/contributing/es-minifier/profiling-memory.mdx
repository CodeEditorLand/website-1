title: Profiling Memory Usage
---

## Steps to run the memory profiler for the minifier on mac:

If you have a problem with SWC minifier about memory allocation and you are on mac, you can use [`ddt`][] to profile the memory usage.

### Step 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swc-project/swc.git
cd ./swc/crates/swc_ecma_minifier
```

### Step 2. Run the profiler

The command to run the profiler is as follows:

```bash
CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_DEBUG=1 RUST_LOG=off ddt profile instruments cargo -t 'Memory' --release --features concurrent --example minify-all -- ~/projects/minifier-inputs  to the directory containing your input files. It can be either a file or a directory containing the input files. All .js files will be minified (without writing the result to the disk)
```

Replace `~/projects/minifier-inputs` with the directory containing your input files. It can be either a file or a directory containing the input files.
All .js files will be minified, without writing the result to the disk.

If you want to check the example directory for inputs, you can take a look at https://github.com/kdy1/swc-minifier-inputs.
